The main script is found in main.py.

The source data is in sourcefiles folder, including the task requirements.
The python code is heavily commented, so each decision is explained in comments.

The code is used to generate 3 datasets, of which I ended up using 2 in my looker report.
These are revenue.csv, revenue_cost.csv, revenue_x_installs.csv.

The looker report can be found in the looker_report folder both as an attached pdf
and also via link to the looker report itself.
